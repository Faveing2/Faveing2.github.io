# Introduction

I was once a computer science major however I decided to switch to physics. One of my big motivations for this change was the idea of combining both my passion for computer science and physics, thus my interest in computational physics was born. While doing my undergrad I had many amazing oppurtunities to explore this interest of mine. Working with MC particle simulations such as GEANT and making my own simulation of our muon detectors. Now that I'm out of undergrad I want to explore this interest on my own. That's exactly what this project aims to be. I intend it to be a starting point for me developing and practicing my skills in this field. I also want this project to be simpler to start off, computational physics can be a very deep subject. 

Basically I want to
