As I was writing a post about another project, I realized that it would be really nice to render LaTeX within my posts! Turns out that's perfectly possible with Hugo and the theme I'm using, [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). This post is simply a guide that I (and others) can use as a reference in the future. I didn’t develop anything new here—I just gathered knowledge from different sources to achieve what I wanted.

# Guide

First, I found [this article](https://geoffruddock.com/math-typesetting-in-hugo/) on how to set up MathJax 3 rendering within Hugo. It’s where I learned that I needed to modify my theme. This posed a problem since I was using it as a GitHub submodule, which I couldn’t directly edit. So I forked the hugo-PaperMod repository to my own GitHub [repo](https://github.com/Faveing2/hugo-PaperMod).

With my own fork, I added the file `layouts/partials/mathjax_support.html` to the project and included the following code:

```html
<script>
  MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\(', '\\)']],
      displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ['\\[', '\\]']],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      skipHtmlTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre']
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
    document.querySelectorAll("mjx-container").forEach(function(x){
      x.parentElement.classList += ' has-jax'
    });
  });
</script>
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```

Next, I added the following code to the very top of `layouts/partials/header.html`:

```html
<head>
  {{ if .Params.mathjax }}{{ partial "mathjax_support.html" . }}{{ end }}
</head>
```

Back in the repository for this website, I created a custom CSS file at `assets/css/custom.css` and added the following:

```css
code.has-jax {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  background: inherit !important;
  border: none !important;
  font-size: 100%;
}
```

Lastly, now that MathJax is being loaded, we just need to enable it per post by adding `mathjax: true` to the front matter.

Now I have LaTeX rendering support in my posts!
