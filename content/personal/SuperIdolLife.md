I was looking forward to this event ever since it was announced. I mean, knowing Peoni, Phoebe, and Ashton were going to be there of course this had to be an insane event. And it did not disappoint at all! Amazing setlists, amazing performers, and wotagei shenanigans it had it all!

### Friday

To get to Super Idol Life, I was carpooling with a couple of friends. Before meeting up with them, however, I stopped at a boba shop called [Boba & More](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEANsjwrvdQeE9ST9) in Dublin and picked up the first spam musubi I’ve ever had. Naturally, I had to take an oshikatsu photo. After eating it, I realized I really need more spam musubi in my life.

Once my friends picked me up from the boba shop, we started our ~6-hour journey to Little Tokyo, LA! Honestly, there isn’t much to say about the car ride—just your typical road trip shenanigans, like listening to all 22 minutes of [“Why *Morning Glory Milking Farm* is a Critique About Late-Stage Capitalism and Toxic Masculinity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U882Z8g9UWg), and practicing the mixes and calls for songs we thought would be in the setlists. We got to our hotel around 3 a.m. and just passed out.

### Saturday - Super Idol Life

Finally it was the day of the event I was looking foward to for almost a month. You may think it would start with breakfast or something normal? Nope I started the day door dashing new underwear since I forgot to pack any oops lol. Well after the underwear situation I went to a [Ramen Yamadaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1xi3YCVrgFMYP5tH9) with some friends. I ordered a chiken katsu bowl (which I ate before I took any photos). After the ramen
