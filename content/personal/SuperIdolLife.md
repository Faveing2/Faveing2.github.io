I was looking forward to this event ever since it was announced. I mean, knowing Peoni, Phoebe, Ashton, and Hyuni were going to be there, of course this had to be an insane event and it did not disappoint at all! Amazing setlists, amazing performers, and wotagei shenanigans it had it all!

### Friday

To get to Super Idol Life, I was carpooling with a couple of friends. Before meeting up with them, though, I stopped at a boba shop called [Boba & More](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEANsjwrvdQeE9ST9) in Dublin and picked up the first spam musubi I‚Äôve ever had. Naturally, I had to take an oshikatsu photo. After eating it, I realized I really need more spam musubi in my life.

Once my friends picked me up from the boba shop, we started our ~6-hour journey to Little Tokyo, LA! Honestly, there isn‚Äôt much to say about the car ride just your typical road trip antics, like listening to all 22 minutes of [‚ÄúWhy *Morning Glory Milking Farm* is a Critique About Late-Stage Capitalism and Toxic Masculinity‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U882Z8g9UWg), and practicing the mixes and calls for songs we thought would be in the setlists. We got to our hotel around 3 a.m. and just passed out for the night.

### Saturday - Super Idol Life

Finally, it was the day of the event I‚Äôd been looking forward to for almost a month. You might think the day would start with breakfast or something normal but nope, I started the day by DoorDashing new underwear because I forgot to pack any. Oops lol. 

After resolving the underwear situation, I went to [Ramen Yamadaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1xi3YCVrgFMYP5tH9) with some friends. I ordered a chicken katsu bowl (which I ate before I could take any photos oops again). After lunch and hanging out, we finally made our way to Super Idol Life!

[Utano Pandora](https://x.com/UtanoPandora) opened the day with a set full of absolute bangers like *Ikenai Borderline* and *Hamtaro*. Of course, we had to start the Hamtaro circle in the venue. Which was definitely challenging in such a small venue but we made it work!

Next was Peoni's set. It was absolutely packed with mixes, calls, and all kinds of shenanigans.

*Call2* was a song Peoni introduced me to about a month ago, and I instantly fell in love with it along with *Call from Nippon Wachacha*. Finally getting to hear and mix to these songs live was incredibly fun and fulfilling.

For *Lemon Lemonade*, a few of us planned a bit where we squeeze a lemon and drink lemonade during the song. This came from a video of someone doing the same at a Zerokara Start concert in Japan. Originally, we planned to do this in the audience. One way or another, we ended up doing it on stage, and it turned out to be such a fun experience. I‚Äôve been wanting to do this bit ever since I saw that video, so getting to do it during my oshi‚Äôs set was truly heartwarming.

I didn‚Äôt get to see much of the last sets, sadly, as I was outside the venue cooling off and catching up with friends. But after Super Idol Life wrapped up, I went to dinner with SanFlare, Goon Squad, and others at [Chinchikurin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SBRHPLr6oQz3L6in8). Of course, after a hype event like this, I had to get a big fat Sapporo beer!

We finished the night drinking, eating, and hanging out before finally crashing around 2 a.m. All in all, this trip was an amazing way to end my summer vacation. I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîgoing to so many events this summer has been exhausting, but it felt so worth it!
