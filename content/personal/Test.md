# Introduction

So, I decided to start a blog. Why? Who knows. I don’t expect anyone to actually read anything I post here — it’s more of a space for me to put down my thoughts and personalize things to my liking.

I’m Faveing, also known as Fave — just a nerdy weeb who enjoys anime, physics, computers, wotagei, and astronomy. I’m currently working toward my master’s degree in physics, with the goal of becoming a teacher.

When I’m not at school, I enjoy playing games, hanging out with friends, doing wotagei, and programming.

# What Will Be on This Website

On this website, I plan to regularly post blog updates about current projects or life — mainly as a form of self-documentation. I’ll also share astrophotography photos, links to things I enjoy, and whatever else I decide to post later on.
